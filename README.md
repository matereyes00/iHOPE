iHOPE is a hybrid optimization and prioritization system that looks for new locations to put up rural health units (RHUs) in the Philippines. The goal is to automate the process of determining the suitability of a location to put up a RHU, based on certain geographic factors and population data. The system is broken down into 3 parts: data pre-processing, optimization, and prioritization. 

## Data pre-processing
## Optimization
## Prioritization

*Limitations*: 
(1) This study is a proof of concept. The data for this study was chosen based on availability at the time of experimentation. While this study was being conducted, there is no formal or official list provided by the DOH in the Philippine Health Facility Development Plan 2020-2040 saying which geographic and population factors to consider for putting up health facilities. There is, however, the number of facilities targeted for the years 2025 and 2040. 
(2) The number of existing rural health units is not exact. The study retrieved the RHUs from the DOH database of active facilities: <link>. 

A static website entitled I-HOPE System was created to visually represent and guide the reader on the flow of data through the I-HOPE. The website to the static website can be found here: <link>.
